      <h4>Dear Participants:</h4>
      <p>
        The Cognitive Neuroscience Lab at the University of Lethbridge invites you to participate in an investigation of auditory and visual perception.<br>
        Your participation is entirely voluntary and has no bearing on any other aspect of your coursework or employment.<br><br>

        Before you begin, we will ask you to complete a brief questionnaire to record some basic information to help us interpret the results of the study.<br><br>

        The information from this study will be reported in general terms at conferences and in scientific journals without reference to your particular results.<br>
        It is emphasized that this is not a diagnostic test and we can't make any determination about your health using this technique.<br><br>

        We hope that you will participate in this study, but if for any reason you decide to withdraw,<br>
        you are free to do so at any time and with no penalty whatsoever and your data will be destroyed.<br><br>

        The data collected are confidential and your results are attached only to an arbitrary assigned ID code.<br>
        However, if you are participating for course credit, we will record your name, student ID and the course name.<br>
        This will allow us to pass the information to your instructor at the end of the term.<br>
        No data will be attached to this record, and if you decide to not complete the experiment your results will not be used.<br><br>

        Questions about this experiment can be addressed to Dr. Matthew Tata at the University of Lethbridge [Email: matthew.tata@uleth.ca].<br>
        Questions regarding your rights as a participant in this research may be addressed to the Office of Research Services, University of Lethbridge [Phone: (403) 329-2747].<br><br>
