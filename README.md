# McGurkExperiment
The code for running my McGurk Experiment

This is my first time using PHP and creating a website with backend interaction

The site takes videos hosted on the same server and then plays them for the participants before accepting a response that is saved to a backend database. It is still quite buggy, but it does it's job and allowed my human trials to be completed while in lockdown
